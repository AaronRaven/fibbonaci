# Overview

{Important! Do not say in this section that this is college assignment. Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.}

{Provide a description of the software that you wrote to demonstrate the JavaScript language.}
I developed two programs, a Fibonacci counter with recursion and a To-Do List application,  to learn and practice JavaScript and to improve my skills in building applications.

The Fibonacci counter uses recursion to generate Fibonacci numbers, while the To-Do List application utilizes HTML for display output and  Native Array ES6 functions such as push(), splice(), and forEach() for task management. Basic error handling is implemented using IF statements.

{Describe your purpose for writing this software.}
I wrote these programs as part of my journey to learn JavaScript and as foundaition to move into React Native, which is based on it.


{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

{Describe the tools that you used to develop the software}
I used Visual Studio Code  for writing and debugging the code. I used opera browser to run it.


{Describe the programming language that you used and any libraries.}
I exclusively used native JavaScript without any additional libraries;thought I did learn React Native, but could not run it because emulators did not work on my PC.


# Useful Websites

{Make a list of websites that you found helpful in this project}

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}
There are quite a few things that I could to do improve it;
- Refactor code for better readability and maintainability.
- Implement additional features such as task prioritization and due dates in the To-Do List application.
- Enhance user interface for better user experience.
- Explore the possibility of remaking the applications into a React Native phone app for cross-platform compatibility.
